# Netflix-Engagement-Analysis (Interactive dashboard creation using MS Excel and Power BI)
## Project Objective
A Netflix dataset was studied and analyzed to prepare a dashboard for gaining insights into user behavior, engagement patterns, and subscription trends. This will further help in decision-making for managers of netflix.

### Questions (KPIs):-
1. What is the average engagement rate across all users?
2. How many promotional profiles have been created?
3. What is the total number of churned users?
4. How does the average watch time vary across different age groups (Teenage, Adult, Senior)?
5. What percentage of users in each age group have churned?
6. Which device is most commonly used for watching (Smart TV, Tablet, Laptop, Mobile)?
7. How does user satisfaction compare across different devices?
8. Which subscription plan has the longest average subscription length?
9. How does the usage of promotional offers vary by subscription plan?
10. What are the genre preferences by region?
11. How do engagement and churn rates correlate with the number of support queries logged?

1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**: Removed irrelevant columns, handled missing values, grouped queries.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Created 'Age Group','Support Queries Logged Group', 'Churn Rate %', and 'Avg Engagement' measures.
3. **Visualizations Created**:
   - Line chart (Support Queries Logged Group vs Churn Rate)
   - Donut chart (Subscription Plan vs Promotional Offer Use)
   - Cards for KPI insights (e.g., Avg Engagement, Churn Rate %)
   - Region-wise user distribution for Genre Preference
